## Description

This is a full stack web application using MVC framework and RESTful API to create a functional blog. When using the site, a user is able to login by creating a username and password, login in and logout with said information. The application uses authorization of login credentials to display a user dashboard with their own posts when they are logged in. Once logged in, the client is able to view existing blog posts (including a dashboard with their own collection of posts), add a new post or comment on an existing post as well as update or delete their own post if desired.
